    <p>
      Each section of this page is marked by headings of different levels. This
      helps organize the information hierarchically and makes it easier to read.
      HTML provides six levels of headings, from <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> to
      <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code>.

    <h3>Importance of Headings</h3>
    <p>
      Headings are important for both accessibility and SEO. They help screen
      readers navigate the content and allow search engines to better understand
      the structure of your page.
